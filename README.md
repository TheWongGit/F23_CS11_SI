## Getting started
### Installing git on Windows (Cygwin)
If you are on Windows, you have probably already installed Cygwin on your device. When you were installing, Cygwin gave you the option to install additional packages, one of these was for Git. Chances are you did not install this, but that is okay we can add packages after installation (kinda). There is no package management in Cygwin outside of the setup program, so you will have to run setup-x86_64.exe again. 
1. Open `File Explore` then to `Downloads` on your device
2. Search for `setup-x86_64.exe` and open the file
3. Go through the set up process again (choose the same options as last time) until you reach the `Select Packages` page. Here use the search tool to search for "Git". Choose the package named `Git` with description `Distributed version control system`

    Note: now is a good time to install any additional packages you may want like Vim
4. Finish the rest of the set up process
5. Open your Cygwin terminal and confirm git has been properly installed by running
    ```sh
    git --version
    ```
    You should get back something that looks like `git version 2.39.0`

### Installing git on Mac and Linux
1. By default, git should be installed on Mac and Linux systems
2. Confirm git is installed by running the following command in your terminal
    ```sh
    git --version
    ```
    You should get back something that looks like `git version 2.39.0`
3. If you did not get a version number, follow the this guide: [Install Git](https://github.com/git-guides/install-git)

### Create a GitHub account
GitHub is the free web based platform we and many other software engineers use to share and collaborate on projects as well as control version history.

1. Go to [GitHub](https://github.com/) and follow the steps to create an account
2. Return to the terminal (cygwin or your standard terminal) to configure git
3. Set up your username using the following command where `<your_GitHub_username>` is the username you chose when creating your GitHub account
    ```sh
    git config --global user.name <your_GitHub_username>
    ```
     ```sh
    git config --global user.name CS11SI
    ```
4. Set up your email using the following command where `<your_GitHub_email>` is the email you used when creating your GitHub account
    ```sh
    git config --global user.name <your_GitHub_email>
    ```
     ```sh
    git config --global user.name stlheure@cabrillo.edu
    ```



Go through the setup process again. When you get to Select Packages search for Git
Select the one named “git” with description “Distributed version control system”
Finish the setup and confirm git is installed with git --version
