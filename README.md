# Getting started
## 0Ô∏è‚É£ Installing git (Cygwin)
If you are on Windows, you have probably already installed Cygwin on your device. When you were installing, Cygwin gave you the option to install additional packages, one of these was for Git. Chances are you did not install this, but that is okay we can add packages after installation (kinda). There is no package management in Cygwin outside of the setup program, so you will have to run setup-x86_64.exe again. 
1. Open `File Explore` then to `Downloads` on your device
2. Search for `setup-x86_64.exe` and open the file
3. Go through the set up process again (choose the same options as last time) until you reach the `Select Packages` page. Here use the search tool to search for "Git". Choose the package named `Git` with description `Distributed version control system`
    ![packages](https://github.com/steph1111/F23_CS11_SI/assets/96219204/05954a94-ad7e-4596-855d-8a042905df34)
    Note: now is a good time to install any additional packages you may want like Vim
4. Finish the rest of the set up process
5. Open your Cygwin terminal and confirm git has been properly installed by running
    ```sh
    git --version
    ```
    You should get back something that looks like `git version 2.39.0`

## 0Ô∏è‚É£ Installing git (Mac and Linux)
1. By default, git should be installed on Mac and Linux systems
2. Confirm git is installed by running the following command in your terminal

    You should get back something that looks like `git version 2.39.0`
3. If you did not get a version number, follow the this guide: [Install Git](https://github.com/git-guides/install-git)

2. Return to your terminal and navigate using `cd` to where you would like this repo contents to live with your file system
3. To clone your repo use the `git clone` command and paste the link from step 1. This points to the existing repo on GitHub and makes a connected copy, or clone, on your system
    ```sh
    git clone <link_here>
    ```
    Here is an example of how I would clone my repo (your link is different)
    ```sh
    git clone git@github.com:steph1111/F23_CS11_SI.git
    ```
4. To confirm the clone was successful list your files with `ls`. You should see the name of the cloned repo in your current directory

# Maintaining your repo

## Sync and pull the changes
I will be updating my upstream version of your repo before SI sessions to add new content. In order to get the new content into your repo you must sync and pull the changes
1. Every time you want to work on your repo I recommend heading to your repo and syncing the changes.
