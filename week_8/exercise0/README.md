# Instructions
**Objective:** Write a program that determines if a word is a palindrome 

## Background information 
The word palindrome comes from greek and means “running back”. A palindrome is something that reads the same forwards and backwards. 
This can be a word, sentence, or number. `civic` is a palindrome, if you reverse the order of the letters, the word is the same. `noon` is another example. Note that in this program we will be looking at single words.

Write a program that takes in two integers and prints whether  it lies in the First, Second, Third, or Fourth Quadrant.

## Steps
1. Prompt the user for a word
2. Determine if it is a palindrome
3. Output wether it is a palindrome

## Test Cases
```
Test 1
Enter a word: hello
false
```

```
Test 2
Enter a word: civic
true
```

```
Test 3
Enter a word: noon
true
```

```
Test 4
Enter a word: racecas
false
```

## Challenge
Traditionally, when looking at palindromes, we will ignore spaces, capitalization, and punctuation. Modify the program to account for this.
```
Test 1
Enter a word: hello world
false
```
