# Instructions
**Objective:** Get familiar working with GitHub for SI practice programs

## Background information 
Congratulations you have set up GitHub! We did a lot so this may seem overwhelming, but you will get used to GitHub and luckily we only have to set this up once. Next we are going to look at how you will use GitHub for practice programs in SI

## Steps 
1. Make sure you have completed all the steps for [getting started](https://github.com/steph1111/F23_CS11_SI/tree/main#getting-started) with GitHub. This means you should have your forked repo cloned on your system
2. Open the `welcome.cpp` file in a code editor of your choice
3. Change the text such that `<your_name>` is your actual name
4. Compile and run the program to ensure it works properly
5. Commit your changes with the `commit` command
    ```sh
    git commit -m "My first commit" welcome.cpp
    ``` 
6. Push your changes to GitHub with the `push` command
    ```sh
    git push
    ```
7. Open the repo through GitHub in your browser to ensure the changes you made are reflected there
